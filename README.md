## Node.js API with Express & MongoDB

This is a repository for the files used in learning Node.js in Brad Traversy's [Node.js API Masterclass With Express & MongoDB](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-api-masterclass/) course on Udemy. As of the date of this repo's creation (Dec 2019), I have about a year's worth of front-end web developer experience and am looking to further my skills by learning more about how to create a backend API and use some common tech stacks. Feel free to use any of this code or contact me if you have questions.
